Project Governance and Policies
1. Code of Conduct Policy

All contributors must maintain professionalism, respect, and ethical behaviour when collaborating on the project.
This includes:

Respecting all team members and their ideas.

Avoiding offensive or inappropriate language in commits or comments.

Following the project’s coding and review guidelines.

Example line for report:

“The team followed a clear code of conduct ensuring respectful collaboration and ethical contribution to the project’s development.”

2. Version Control Policy

GitHub was used to manage source control.
Policies applied:

Every new feature was developed in a separate branch (e.g., feature/login).

Pull requests had to be reviewed by at least one teammate before merging.

The main branch always remained stable and production-ready.

Descriptive commit messages were mandatory.

Example line for report:

“A structured Git branching model was followed to maintain a clean version history and prevent conflicts.”

3. DevOps / CI/CD Policy

The DevOps process ensured continuous integration and testing.
Policies included:

Automatic build triggers when code is pushed to main.

Code reviews before deployment.

Regular backups of pipeline configurations.

Secure connection between GitHub and Azure DevOps.

Example line for report:

“The DevOps pipeline automatically validated code quality and built the app upon each commit.”

4. Security Policy

User data and credentials are treated with confidentiality.
Policies included:

No sensitive keys (e.g., API, Firebase) were pushed to GitHub.

Authentication data stored securely in Firebase Authentication.

Devices locked with secure screen patterns.

HTTPS communication enforced for APIs.

Example line for report:

“All authentication processes follow Firebase’s security protocols to protect user information.”

5. Privacy Policy

Users’ personal data (like email addresses) are used only for authentication and support purposes.
Data is not shared with third parties.
If the app were to go live, a full privacy policy would be hosted on the website or within the app.

Example line for report:

“User data collected through Firebase is strictly limited to login and registration functionality.”

6. Backup and Recovery Policy

All code is pushed to GitHub daily to ensure project continuity.
In case of data loss:

Latest working version can be restored from GitHub.

Android Studio also creates local history backups automatically.

Example line for report:

“Daily repository pushes to GitHub served as a disaster recovery strategy for the development team.”

7. Access Control Policy

Access to GitHub and DevOps was limited to authorized team members and lecturers.
Each member’s role (Admin / Contributor / Viewer) was clearly defined.

Example line for report:

“Role-based access control ensured that only authorized users could modify the repository.”

8. Quality Assurance (QA) Policy

Testing was done before merging to main.
Includes:

Manual testing of login, registration, and navigation.

Debug logs checked for crashes.

UI validation for consistent colors and layout.

Example line for report:

“Quality assurance testing was applied on all major functions before deployment.”

9. Documentation Policy

All modules and activities were properly commented.
A README file and DevOps documentation were maintained.
Screenshots and code comments ensure that new contributors can easily understand the system.

Example line for report:

“Project documentation is continuously updated alongside development.”

10. Environmental and Sustainability Policy

The app minimizes energy and data consumption by:

Using efficient background tasks.

Avoiding unnecessary API calls.

Encouraging digital, paperless towing requests.

Example line for report:

“The project promotes sustainability by reducing paper-based operations and optimizing energy usage.”

Conclusion

The TowingApp’s governance and policy framework ensures:

Professional collaboration

Security and privacy compliance

Stable and sustainable development practices
